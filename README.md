# GwentAPI
The code for GwentAPI

GwentAPI is a RESTful API dedicated to provide information regarding GWENTÂ®: The Witcher Card Game. You may use its interface to consume information on cards, factions, etc. You can find the API documentation at [https://gwentapi.com/swagger/](https://gwentapi.com/swagger/).


# How to use

GwentAPI is release for both Linux and Windows. You can find the download [here](https://github.com/GwentAPI/gwentapi/releases).
The data allowing you to seed the database is included in the releases. Read the file ``DATABASE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`` to know how to feed the database.

Change the values found in ``config.toml`` to suit your environment. The configuration file must be kept in the same directory as the executable. 


# Install from source

## Requirement & dependencies

## Installation

Assuming you installed and configure all the required softwares listed above and that you have a working Go setup:

### Build the software
1. ``go get github.com/GwentAPI/gwentapi``
3. GwentAPI uses the expimental [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) tool to manage the Go dependencies, however they are included in the ``vendor`` directory to help build the software on CI platforms.
4. Change your monboDB credentials in the ``init()`` of the ``/dataLayer/dal/db.go`` file if needed. By default it connects to localhost on no particular users (no SSL, access control not enabled).
5. Compile:
    * ``go build``
6. Optionally set the version of the binary (displayed with the -v flag) by changing the value of ``version`` in ``main.go`` before compiling or set it at compile time with the following command:
    * ``go build -ldflags="-X main.version=<versionString>" ``
7. Optionally modify the ``baseURL`` in the ``config.toml`` file to change where resources are pointing to.

**The program will run on localhost on port 8080 by default.**

## How to contribute?

Read the ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` file.

## Where are the artworks and why does latest.jsonl refers to gwentify?

latest.jsonl is generated by [Arachas](https://github.com/GwentAPI/arachas) a web crawler that extract data from [gwentify.com](http://gwentify.com).

GwentAPI doesn't hot link to gwentify and so, the database population script will replace the url. The artworks isn't included because git doesn't like binary files and neither do I like including binary files in git.
